## Best Practices for ML Project Folder Organization

### 1. The Gold Standard: Cookiecutter Data Science

The most widely adopted template in the ML community is **Cookiecutter Data Science**, which has become the de facto standard. Here's their recommended structure:

```
├── LICENSE            ← Open-source license
├── Makefile           ← Makefile with commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          ← The top-level README for developers
├── data
│   ├── external       ← Data from third party sources
│   ├── interim        ← Intermediate data that has been transformed
│   ├── processed      ← The final, canonical data sets for modeling
│   └── raw            ← The original, immutable data dump
│
├── docs               ← Documentation (MkDocs/Sphinx)
├── models             ← Trained and serialized models, model predictions
├── notebooks          ← Jupyter notebooks with naming convention
│                         (e.g., 1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration)
├── references         ← Data dictionaries, manuals, explanatory materials
├── reports            ← Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
│   └── figures        ← Generated graphics and figures
│
├── requirements.txt   ← Dependencies for reproducing the environment
└── src                ← Source code for use in this project
    ├── __init__.py    ← Makes src a Python module
    ├── config.py      ← Store useful variables and configuration
    ├── dataset.py     ← Scripts to download or generate data
    ├── features.py    ← Code to create features for modeling
    ├── modeling       
    │   ├── __init__.py 
    │   ├── predict.py ← Code to run model inference
    │   └── train.py   ← Code to train models
    └── plots.py       ← Code to create visualizations
```

### 2. Andrew Ng's Approach

From Andrew Ng's courses and projects, the structure emphasizes:

**Course Structure** (from his Machine Learning Specialization):
```
├── C1 - Supervised Machine Learning/
├── C2 - Advanced Learning Algorithms/
├── C3 - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning/
├── resources/
└── README.md
```

**Individual Project Structure** (from his teachings):
- Clear separation between **training** and **testing** phases
- Emphasis on **iterative development** with numbered notebooks
- Strong focus on **reproducibility** and **documentation**

### 3. Fast.ai's Approach (Jeremy Howard)

Fast.ai uses a very clean, practical structure:

```
├── clean/             ← Clean notebooks without outputs
├── images/            ← Images for documentation
├── tools/             ← Utility scripts
├── 01_intro.ipynb     ← Numbered learning progression
├── 02_production.ipynb
├── ...
├── environment.yml    ← Conda environment
├── requirements.txt   ← Python dependencies
└── utils.py          ← Shared utility functions
```

**Key principles from Jeremy Howard:**
- **Numbered notebooks** for logical progression
- **Clean separation** between exploration and production code
- **Minimal but effective** structure
- **Environment reproducibility** first

### 4. Modern ML Project Structure (2024 Best Practices)

Based on current industry standards:

```
project_name/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/     ← CI/CD pipelines
├── config/            ← Configuration files (YAML, JSON)
├── data/
│   ├── raw/          ← Original, immutable data
│   ├── processed/    ← Cleaned data ready for modeling
│   ├── features/     ← Feature engineering outputs
│   └── predictions/  ← Model predictions
├── experiments/       ← Experiment tracking and configs
├── models/           ← Saved models, checkpoints
├── notebooks/        ← Jupyter notebooks for exploration
│   ├── 01-data-exploration.ipynb
│   ├── 02-feature-engineering.ipynb
│   ├── 03-model-training.ipynb
│   └── 04-evaluation.ipynb
├── src/
│   ├── data/         ← Data loading and preprocessing
│   ├── features/     ← Feature engineering
│   ├── models/       ← Model definitions and training
│   ├── visualization/ ← Plotting and visualization
│   └── utils/        ← Utility functions
├── tests/            ← Unit tests
├── scripts/          ← Training and inference scripts
├── docker/           ← Docker configurations
├── docs/             ← Documentation
├── requirements.txt
├── pyproject.toml    ← Modern Python packaging
├── Makefile          ← Common commands
└── README.md
```

### 5. Training vs Testing Organization

For **training and testing models**, the best practices include:

**Option A: Separate by Purpose**
```
├── src/
│   ├── training/
│   │   ├── train.py
│   │   ├── validate.py
│   │   └── hyperparameter_tuning.py
│   ├── inference/
│   │   ├── predict.py
│   │   ├── evaluate.py
│   │   └── test.py
│   └── models/
│       ├── model_definitions.py
│       └── architectures/
```

**Option B: Unified Model Directory** (Andrew Ng style)
```
├── src/
│   └── models/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── train_model.py
│       ├── predict_model.py
│       ├── evaluate_model.py
│       └── model_architectures.py
```

### 6. Key Principles from Famous ML Practitioners

**From Andrew Ng:**
- **Systematic iteration**: Clear progression from basic to advanced
- **Reproducible experiments**: Every experiment should be reproducible
- **Clear documentation**: Explain why decisions were made
- **Version control everything**: Code, data versions, model versions

**From Jeremy Howard (Fast.ai):**
- **Start simple**: Begin with the simplest possible approach
- **Notebook-driven development**: Use notebooks for exploration, scripts for production
- **End-to-end before optimization**: Get the full pipeline working first
- **Practical over perfect**: Ship working solutions

**From Cookiecutter Data Science:**
- **Data is immutable**: Never modify raw data
- **Notebooks are for exploration**: Refactor code into modules
- **Environment reproducibility**: Pin all dependencies
- **Separation of concerns**: Each directory has a clear purpose

### 7. Modern Tools Integration

Current best practices also include:
- **MLflow/Weights & Biases** for experiment tracking
- **DVC** for data version control  
- **Hydra** for configuration management
- **Docker** for environment consistency
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

### 8. Recommended Folder Structure for Your Project

Based on all these practices, here's what I'd recommend for a typical ML project:

```
your_project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   ├── features/
│   └── splits/           ← train/val/test splits
├── experiments/          ← Experiment configs and results
├── models/              ← Saved models and checkpoints
├── notebooks/           ← Numbered for progression
├── src/
│   ├── data/            ← Data processing
│   ├── features/        ← Feature engineering  
│   ├── models/          ← Training and inference
│   ├── evaluation/      ← Metrics and evaluation
│   └── utils/           ← Shared utilities
├── tests/               ← Unit tests
├── configs/             ← Configuration files
├── scripts/             ← CLI scripts for training/inference
├── requirements.txt
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

This structure combines the best elements from Andrew Ng's systematic approach, Jeremy Howard's practical simplicity, and the Cookiecutter Data Science standard, while incorporating modern MLOps practices.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for protein embedding generation)

### Installation


## Usage

### Data Pipeline

1. **Data Analysis**: Start with `notebooks/01_full_dataset_analyze.ipynb`
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run `notebooks/02_seperate_medium_dataset.ipynb`
3. **Embedding Generation**: Execute `notebooks/03_embed_ESMC.ipynb`
4. **Feature Standardization**: Use `notebooks/04_embeddings_standardize.ipynb`

### Model Training & Experiments


### Model Evaluation

Use scripts in `src/evaluation/` for comprehensive model assessment:


## Experiment Tracking

All experiments are systematically organized in the `experiments/` folder:

- Each experiment includes comprehensive analysis and results
- Hyperparameter tuning results are saved for reproducibility
- Model comparison metrics are tracked across all approaches

## Results

Results and model outputs are stored in:
- `src/results/` - Processed analysis results
- `models/` - Trained model checkpoints
- `logs/` - Training logs and metrics

## Development

### Adding New Experiments

1. Create a new notebook in `experiments/` with descriptive naming
2. Follow the established pattern of data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation
3. Save results and model checkpoints appropriately

### Code Organization

- **Data Processing**: Add new data utilities to `src/data/`
- **Model Architectures**: Define new models in `src/model/`
- **Training Logic**: Implement training procedures in `src/training/`
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Add evaluation functions to `src/evaluation/`

## Contributing

1. Follow the established folder structure
2. Use numbered notebooks for logical progression
3. Document all experiments thoroughly
4. Add unit tests for new functionality in `tests/`
